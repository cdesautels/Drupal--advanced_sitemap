==========

This module basically prints out the navigation menu of your choice as a site map, like some other site map modules. What it does different is that it adds column breaks so you can create multi-column site maps. That's it's primary purpose, but it has a couple of extras tossed in, to what effect, I don't really know, but they're there none the less.

You can select which menus you want to have used and control the order in which they're printed out.

There are prefix and suffix sections in which you can manually enter items for the site map that don't exist in the menu structure.

You can designate optional wrappers that may be of use for styling.

By itself, this module won't create the multi-column layout. It will just break a menu <ul> into two or more <ul>'s. It's dependent on the developer to turn these into multi-colums with css.
